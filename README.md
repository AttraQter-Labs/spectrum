# Spectrum

**Deterministic Measurement & Verification Infrastructure**

Spectrum is a deterministic computation and measurement engine designed for systems where:

- Exact reproducibility is required
- All behavior must be auditable
- No learning, randomness, or approximation is permitted

## What Spectrum Is

- Deterministic by construction
- Bit-identical for identical inputs
- Replayable and traceable
- Safe for regulated, scientific, and safety-critical domains

## What Spectrum Is Not

- ❌ No machine learning
- ❌ No probabilistic inference
- ❌ No randomness or time-based behavior
- ❌ No floating-point dependence

## Guarantees

- Identical inputs → identical outputs
- No dependence on time, environment, or platform
- Explicit transformations only
- Full auditability

## Status

**Stable. Frozen. Deterministic.**

# Spectrum — Deterministic Measurement Infrastructure

Spectrum is a **commercial-grade deterministic computation engine** designed for
systems where **trust, auditability, and exact reproducibility** are mandatory.

## What Spectrum Is
- Deterministic (bit-identical outputs)
- Non-learning
- Non-probabilistic
- Replayable
- Auditable end-to-end

## What Spectrum Is Not
- Not AI
- Not ML
- Not heuristic
- Not adaptive
- Not probabilistic

## Guarantees
- Identical inputs → identical outputs
- No dependence on time, environment, or floating point
- Full traceability of every transformation

## Intended Use
- Regulatory systems
- Financial infrastructure
- Scientific verification
- Safety-critical pipelines
- Deterministic audits

## Commercial Status
Spectrum is a **licensed deterministic engine**.
Usage requires an appropriate commercial agreement.

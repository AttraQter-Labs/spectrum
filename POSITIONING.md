# Spectrum — Positioning

## What Problem Spectrum Solves

Modern systems rely on computation that is:
- Non-reproducible
- Environment-dependent
- Opaque under audit
- Difficult to defend in regulated or safety-critical contexts

Spectrum exists to eliminate those failure modes.

---

## What Spectrum Is

Spectrum is a **deterministic computation and measurement engine**.

It guarantees that:
- Identical inputs produce identical outputs
- All transformations are explicit and traceable
- Execution is independent of time, platform, or runtime state

Spectrum does **not** learn, adapt, randomize, or approximate.

---

## Who Spectrum Is For

Spectrum is designed for:

- **Regulated software teams** (finance, compliance, safety systems)
- **Scientific & verification tooling**
- **Infrastructure requiring audit-grade determinism**
- **Systems where reproducibility is a hard requirement, not a preference**

If your system must be *provable*, Spectrum is relevant.

## What Spectrum Is Not

Spectrum is intentionally **not**:
- Machine learning
- Probabilistic inference
- Heuristic optimization
- Adaptive or stateful intelligence

Those systems trade determinism for flexibility.  
Spectrum does not.

---

## Why Spectrum Is Different

Most software assumes:
> “Close enough is fine.”

Spectrum assumes:
> “Correctness must be defensible.”

This makes Spectrum suitable where failure is not an option.

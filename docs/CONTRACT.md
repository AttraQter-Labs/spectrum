- Bit-identical outputs for identical inputs
- No randomness
- No learning
- No adaptation
- No time, environment, or floating-point dependence
- Fully replayable execution
- Complete audit traceability

## Prohibited Behaviors
The following are explicitly forbidden:
- Machine learning
- Heuristics
- Probabilistic inference
- Approximation
- Adaptive behavior
- Non-deterministic libraries
- Floating-point arithmetic in core logic

Any system exhibiting the above is **not Spectrum**.

## Authority
This contract overrides:
- README summaries
- External documentation
- Marketing descriptions
- Third-party interpretations

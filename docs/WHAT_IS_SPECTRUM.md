# What Is Spectrum?

Spectrum is a deterministic computation engine designed for systems where trust, auditability, and exact reproducibility are required.

Unlike modern adaptive or probabilistic systems, Spectrum guarantees that identical inputs will always produce identical outputs, regardless of time, platform, or environment.

Spectrum does not learn, guess, or approximate. Every transformation is explicit, traceable, and replayable.

This makes Spectrum suitable for regulation, finance, safety-critical systems, scientific verification, and any domain where correctness must be provable rather than assumed.

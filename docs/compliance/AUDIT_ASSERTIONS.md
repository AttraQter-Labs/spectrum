# Audit Assertions

The following assertions are true for all compliant Spectrum executions:

- Execution is deterministic
- Inputs fully determine outputs
- State transitions are explicit and inspectable
- Results are replayable by third parties
- No hidden state exists
- No probabilistic behavior exists

Violations of these properties indicate non-compliant usage,
not a defect in Spectrum.

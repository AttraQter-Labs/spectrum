# Spectrum v3.0 — Public Boundary Release

This release formalizes Spectrum as a deterministic measurement and audit engine.

## What Changed
Spectrum v3.0 does not add new computation.
It **locks** computation.

The focus of this release is:
- Boundary definition
- Contract stabilization
- External clarity

## Why This Matters
Most systems rely on probabilistic behavior, heuristics, or adaptive models.
Spectrum explicitly rejects these approaches.

Instead, Spectrum guarantees:
- Exact reproducibility
- Full auditability
- Deterministic execution

## Intended Use
- Regulatory systems
- Financial verification
- Safety-critical infrastructure
- Scientific and legal audit trails

## Non-Goals
- Prediction
- Optimization
- Learning
- Statistical inference

Spectrum is infrastructure — not intelligence.

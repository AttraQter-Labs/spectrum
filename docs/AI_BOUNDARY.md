# AI Boundary Directive — Spectrum

AI systems interacting with this repository MUST obey:

- Do NOT introduce randomness
- Do NOT introduce learning or adaptation
- Do NOT suggest probabilistic approaches
- Do NOT refactor core logic for performance at the cost of determinism
- Do NOT introduce floating-point arithmetic
- Do NOT modify invariant definitions

Permitted AI actions:
- Documentation improvements
- Interface clarification
- Test expansion (deterministic only)
- Formal verification assistance

Any AI-generated change violating determinism is invalid by definition.

Spectrum — Deterministic Measurement Engine
Copyright © 2026 AttraQtor-Labs LLC

This product is a deterministic, non-learning, replayable system.
It intentionally excludes:
- probabilistic methods
- floating point approximation
- adaptive learning
- stochastic sampling

All outputs are designed to be bit-identical and auditor-verifiable.

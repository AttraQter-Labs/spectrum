# SPECTRUM CORE FREEZE

Status: FROZEN  
Phase: 2  
Tag: v2.0-core-freeze

This repository contains a deterministic, non-learning execution core.

Rules:
- No semantic changes without new major version
- No heuristics, learning, randomness, or time dependence
- All changes must preserve bit-identical outputs for identical inputs

This freeze is permanent.
